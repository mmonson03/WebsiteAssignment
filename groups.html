            <p>A Pogue is someone who belongs in the working-class of Kildare County. They are typically the ones who work two jobs, and come from long lines of the same class. Sometimes one will be lucky enough to work their way out of Pogue life, however for a majority of the families, they are stuck at the bottom of the totem pole. They are usually fishermen or they work for the Kook families. The teens that consider themselves pogues are a lot more carefree than the Kook teens, which leads them to have a lot more mischevious lives. They typically take jobs like being waiters, cleaning boats, and running charters all for the richer classes. You don't usually see a 'medium' class in Kildare County, however some of the residents do live the 'best of both worlds', like Kiara Carrera.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i> The Kooks : The "Richer" Class</h2>
            <p>Kooks in the series Outer Banks refers to one who is in the wealthy, privileged class in the fictional Kildare County. They are those who come from rich families, most likely ones from old money that have built up wealth for many generations. They often live in luxurious homes, own luxurious boats, and never have to worry about working a day in their life. They are the types of people on the island to have two houses, and two housekeepers. The term 'Kook' is mainly used by the teens, as the adults don't really see the full rivalry between Kooks and Pogues. These residents (especially the teens) are a lot more ruthless than the Pogues. They see themselves as higher than the lower class, and treat them pretty poorly. They can get away with a lot of various crimes more than the Pogues. </p>
