                <p>A Pogue is someone who belongs in the working-class of Kildare County. They are typically the ones
                    who work two jobs, and come from long lines of the same class. Sometimes one will be lucky enough to
                    work their way out of Pogue life, however for a majority of the families, they are stuck at the
                    bottom of the totem pole. They are usually fishermen or they work for the Kook families. The teens
                    that consider themselves pogues are a lot more carefree than the Kook teens, which leads them to
                    have a lot more mischevious lives. They typically take jobs like being waiters, cleaning boats, and
                    running charters all for the richer classes. You don't usually see a 'medium' class in Kildare
                    County, however some of the residents do live the 'best of both worlds', like Kiara Carrera.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i> The Kooks : The "Richer" Class</h2>
                <p>Kooks in the series Outer Banks refers to one who is in the wealthy, privileged class in the
                    fictional Kildare County. They are those who come from rich families, most likely ones from old
                    money that have built up wealth for many generations. They often live in luxurious homes, own
                    luxurious boats, and never have to worry about working a day in their life. They are the types of
                    people on the island to have two houses, and two housekeepers. The term 'Kook' is mainly used by the
                    teens, as the adults don't really see the full rivalry between Kooks and Pogues. These residents
                    (especially the teens) are a lot more ruthless than the Pogues. They see themselves as higher than
                    the lower class, and treat them pretty poorly. They can get away with a lot of various crimes more
                    than the Pogues. </p>
