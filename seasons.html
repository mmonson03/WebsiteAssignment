                <h2>Season 1: The Gold</h2>
                <p>Season 1 of Outer Banks follows a group of teens known as the 'Pogues' that reside in Outer Banks,
                    NC. We get to know the group of 4, John B Routledge, JJ Maybank, Pope Heyward, and Kiara Carrera.
                    The four of them discover John B's fathers lifelong research of the shipwreck the Royal Merchant,
                    and they go on a quest to finish Big Johns research. In the meantime, they struggle with battles
                    against the other side, known as the 'Kooks'. They enlist in the help of "kook princess" Sarah
                    Cameron, whose father worked closely with John B's. They uncover long buried secrets, form
                    relationships, and try to survive in the unreal world they call their home.</p>

                <p>After the battle of the gold, and losing majorly to Ward Cameron, the teens are back to square one.
                    The group is split up between the Bahamas and Outer Banks, and they each have battles of their own
                    they need to get through in order to reuinte. The Royal Merchant leads them to discover the Cross of
                    Santo Domingo, and are now tasked with trying to keep a treasure for themselves while it seems like
                    everyone is out to get them. It seems as though they can't outrun their enemies, and one of them is
                    always getting in trouble with the law.</p>

                <p>Not only did the teens lose the cross in an epic final battle, but they also became stranded. Their
                    adventures this season span accross multiple countries, continents even, as they discover old family
                    members, new enemies, and a whole new treasure. They have nothing to lose, like always. The lost
                    city of El Dorado has a lot more to it than just being treasure, though. The enemies this time are
                    much worse than anyone they have faced thus far. Will they finally be able to keep this treasure? Or
                    will it to be taken from them?</p>
